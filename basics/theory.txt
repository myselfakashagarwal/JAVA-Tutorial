Welcome to the world of java 
Java was developed by james gosling at sun micro system but later sold it out to oracle üòÇ
java is object oriented and roubust it is complex but easy to under stand as per as my view of point üòÇ

before going deep into java lets take a small talk 

Program is composed of code and data 
There are two paradigrams in programing ie porcess oriented and object oriented 
process oriented is like code acting on data process oriented is decent when we have small program.
When the program gets large the process oriented approach is hard , Thus difficult to manage the program 
to overcome this pop problems oop was born object orient is like data acting on code.
using oop we can have manyt benefits like scalibility reuseability and easy to manage complexity 

oop have 4 principles 

Abstraction 
Encapsulation 
Inherritance 
Polymorphism 


Abstraction 
We manage complexity with the help of Abstraction, 
Abstractionis implemented with the help of hierachial classification

Encapsulation
Encapsulationis the mechanism which is used to bind code and data it manipulates .
It provides secuerity 
One of the best example of Encapsulation is class (all data and code resides within the class) 

Inherritance
Inherritancecan be defined as methedology according to which a object acquires the properties of other object
Inherritance supports the concept of hierachial classification

Polymorphism
Polymorphism can be defined as using a item more than once aka reuseability of code 
A promient example of Polymorphism is interface 

Enough Small talk lets talk about java üòÇ ‚òïÔ∏è 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

comments = comments are elements in java which are ignored by compiler 

there are three types of comments 
// for single line 
/* ...*/ for multiline 
/**
  *
  */  for documentation 

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

must do in java 

All java files are saved with extension of (.java) because in java source file is ofiicially a compilation unit 
In java class name must be same as file name this is because in java all code resides within the class  

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How java code is compiled 

java compiler=javac
jdk=java development kit
jvm=java virtual machine 
jre=java runtime environment

javac creates a file whose name is same as class but with extension of (.class) this file contains the byte code
of the progarm this byte code is a intermediate representation of instruction that your jvm will execute 

When Java source code is compiled, each individual class is put into its own output file named after the class 
and using the .class extension.

Have a  closer look at java's main method 

All program begins by calling the main method the main method is called when the program gets started 
you have often written this like üëâüèΩpublic staytic void main(String[] args)
This line have a meaning yeh it does have a meaning, jerk off java stereotypes 
public - it is a access specifier the main method is delcared as public as it is called outside the class 
static -the static is a keyword which calls main without creating a particular instance of a class 
void - main method is defined as void since it does not return any value 
String[] args- thre's a one parameter for the main method String[] args this is a array of insatances of class string
