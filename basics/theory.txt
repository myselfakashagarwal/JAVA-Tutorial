Welcome to the world of java 
Java was developed by james gosling at sun micro system but later sold it out to oracle üòÇ
java is object oriented and roubust it is complex but easy to under stand as per as my view of point üòÇ

before going deep into java lets take a small talk 

Program is composed of code and data 
There are two paradigrams in programing ie porcess oriented and object oriented 
process oriented is like code acting on data process oriented is decent when we have small program.
When the program gets large the process oriented approach is hard , Thus difficult to manage the program 
to overcome this pop problems oop was born object orient is like data acting on code.
using oop we can have manyt benefits like scalibility reuseability and easy to manage complexity 

oop have 4 principles 

Abstraction 
Encapsulation 
Inherritance 
Polymorphism 


Abstraction 
We manage complexity with the help of Abstraction, 
Abstractionis implemented with the help of hierachial classification

Encapsulation
Encapsulationis the mechanism which is used to bind code and data it manipulates .
It provides secuerity 
One of the best example of Encapsulation is class (all data and code resides within the class) 

Inherritance
Inherritancecan be defined as methedology according to which a object acquires the properties of other object
Inherritance supports the concept of hierachial classification

Polymorphism
Polymorphism can be defined as using a item more than once aka reuseability of code 
A promient example of Polymorphism is interface 


Enough Small talk lets talk about java üòÇ ‚òïÔ∏è
