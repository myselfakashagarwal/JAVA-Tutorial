Welcome to the world of java 
Java was developed by james gosling at sun micro system but later sold it out to oracle 😂
java is object oriented and roubust it is complex but easy to under stand as per as my view of point 😂

before going deep into java lets take a small talk 

Program is composed of code and data 
There are two paradigrams in programing ie porcess oriented and object oriented 
process oriented is like code acting on data process oriented is decent when we have small program.
When the program gets large the process oriented approach is hard , Thus difficult to manage the program 
to overcome this pop problems oop was born object orient is like data acting on code.
using oop we can have manyt benefits like scalibility reuseability and easy to manage complexity 

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

oop have 4 principles 

Abstraction 
Encapsulation 
Inherritance 
Polymorphism 


Abstraction 
We manage complexity with the help of Abstraction, 
Abstractionis implemented with the help of hierachial classification

Encapsulation
Encapsulationis the mechanism which is used to bind code and data it manipulates .
It provides secuerity 
One of the best example of Encapsulation is class (all data and code resides within the class) 

Inherritance
Inherritancecan be defined as methedology according to which a object acquires the properties of other object
Inherritance supports the concept of hierachial classification

Polymorphism
Polymorphism can be defined as using a item more than once aka reuseability of code 
A promient example of Polymorphism is interface 

Enough Small talk lets talk about java 😂 ☕️

must do in java before opening the gates of the hell 😂

All java files are saved with extension of (.java) because in java source file is ofiicially a compilation unit 
In java class name must be same as file name this is because in java all code resides within the class  

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

How java code is compiled 

javac=java compiler
jdk=java development kit
jvm=java virtual machine 
jre=java runtime environment

javac creates a file whose name is same as class but with extension of (.class) this file contains the byte code
of the progarm this byte code is a intermediate representation of instruction that your jvm will execute 

When Java source code is compiled, each individual class is put into its own output file named after the class 
and using the .class extension.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Java is a collection of whitespace identifiers literals comments opreators seperators and keywords and emotions

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

whitespace = ' '

Java is a free-form language. This means that you do not need to follow any special indentation rules.For instance,
the  program could have been written all on one line or in any other strange way you felt like typing it,
as long as there was at least one whitespace character between each token that was not already delineated by an
operator or separator.In Java, whitespace is a space, tab, or newline.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

comments = comments are elements in java which are ignored by compiler 

there are three types of comments 
// for single line 
/* ...*/ for multiline 
/**
  *
  */  for documentation 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

keywords = keywords can be defined as special words in java that depecites a special meaning to compiler
In addition to keywords java reserves the following words true false and null 

keywords are 

abstract continue for new switch assert default goto package synchronized boolean do if private this break double
implements protected throw byte else import public throws case enum instanceof return transient catch extends int
short try char final interface static void class finally long strictfp volatile const float native super while

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Seperators = They are used to terminate a statement or to sperate a block of code 

semicolon ; - is the most used seperator and is used to termainate a statement
parentheses () - is used in multiple cases including defining a precedence of an expression control statements and loops
curly braces {} - are used to define local scope and define block of code they are also used to inilitize an arrray 
barckets [] -these are used to define arrya types and array size 
comma , - commas are used in many cases including using as seperators in for loops and in declaring multiple variables of 
same datatype 
period . - Used to separate package names from subpackages and classes. Also used to separate a variable or method
from a reference variable. 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

identifiers = indentifiers can be defined as name given to memory location these are thought by user 
examples of identifiers are myvariable, myconsttant, myarray or any thing user wishes to name but
they must not begin with a number because it may confuse compiler either it is variable or value and it must also must not 
have /  and - inbetween character

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

literals= literals are const values stored in variables 
example 69 , 420 , 94 ,007 , 'a' ,"mystringx" and many more 😂

.                                              🥶 DATA TYPES 🥶

Java’s safety and robustness comes from this fact. Let’s see what this means. First, every variable has a type,
every expression has a type, and every type is strictly defined. Second, all assignments,
whether explicit or via parameter passing in method calls, are checked for type compatibility.

Java's datatypes are mainly divided into 2 parts ~
1.Primitive      -    these are predefined in java   these are also called as simple datatype
2.Non Primitive  -    these are defined by users

Sample java program 🧠

import java.util.*;
class myclass
{
  public static void main(String[] args)                                             @java main method
  {
   System.out.println("be water my friend ");                                        @code to print a statement
  }             
}

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Have a  closer look at java's main method 

All program begins by calling the main method the main method is called when the program gets started. Main()
 is basicially a starting point of your program 
you have often written this  👉🏽public static void main(String[] args)
This line have a meaning yeh it does have a meaning, f*** off java stereotypes 
public - it is a access specifier the main method is delcared as public as it is called outside the class 
static -the static is a keyword which calls main without creating a particular instance of a class 
void - main method is defined as void since it does not return any value 
String[] args- thre's a one parameter for the main method String[] args this is a array of insatances of class string
All code inside main method begins with open curly braces { and ends with closing curly braces }


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

System class , output stream , input stream  

Ass 😂 you can read the above program you will find that the line that outputs 'be water my friend' have multiple 
words chained before it. All of these words have a meaning 👇🏼
System- System is a predefined class which provides access to  System 
(💡note S is in capital case in System this is because java is case sensitive)
out,in are used to get access to input output streams 
println(..)-println is a mehod which is used to console the the things inside it (in above example it was a string )
